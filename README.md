    Looking at the stocks specifically FAANG stocks saw an average of about +1 in volatility with Netflix being the most volatile of the Group adding 2% volatility over this timeframe. This data can be found by looking at the "2018-01-01 to 2020-03-11" & "2020-03-13 and 2023-01-01" Date ranges in the code that calculates Volatility. It is also important to note that this '+1%' increase in volatility is also reflected in the Nvidia Stock within the same date ranges. 

    Continuing with the above date ranges, compared to the other cryptocurrency, Bitcoins's volatility remained relatively tame, with the box-plot remaining virtually identical between the two timeframes, and the outliers only raising by about 10% maximum.

    DOGE is where everything changed. on the outset of this project, we knew that Dogecoin would be interesting to graph, but due to the volatility jump from 70% to above 350%, we had to rethink how some of the graphs would make it into the slide-deck. For Perspective, was almost 9 times more volatile than Bitcoin and over 35 times more volatile than Google. 

    Based on Volatility alone, it is simpler to make suggestions on what NOT to invest in. That would be crypto.

    ADVANTAGES OF BRANCHING
1. Multiple people can make changes. 
2. Use of release branches allows you to make different versions of the same thing.
3. Easy and intuitive way to organize your work.
4. Division of tasks. 
    A COMPARISON OF TRADE VOLUME;
a. How does trade volume compare to each company individually and on average.
b. Comparing standard deviation and volatility on a monthly basis [maybe yearly(comparing the effects of Covid from year to year)].
- Box and whisker plot for volatility? (for a fixed/finite period of time)
- Line chart... (seems feasible for multiple data comparison)
- NO VIOLIN PLOT! (maybe ðŸ‘€)
