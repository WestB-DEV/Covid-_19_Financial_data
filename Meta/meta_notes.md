Seeing how Covid affected stocks we wanted to see what other activities affected stock prices - such as the Facebook to Meta name change.
We see the stock price of Facebook rapidly rise during the week prior to Facebook's name change to Meta. This could suggest that investors are embracing the metaverse as an interactive environment for individuals and businesses to interact with activities and potential unique forms of advertising.

During the month after the name Change to Meta, we see that the stock price has lost momentum and recorrected itself back to its range it had the month prior to the name change.


Although not technically a FAANG stock, Invidia experience the highest growth compared to the FAANG stocks durting the first two weeks prior to the Facebook - Meta name chenge. Investors could as well be embrasing Invidia with Meta. Since the metaverse would need supporting systems and GPUs of which Invidia is well known for, investors may have seen potential for Invidia's growth. 

We see that Invidias stock price does fall sujbstantially a month after the Facebook-Meta name change, but still remained roughly 30 points higher than the weeks leading to the name change.

A stock that we see decline prior to the namechange is Microsoft. Microsofts stock began to decline by 5 points the week prior to the namechange, then continuw to decline another 8 points in the preceding the name change. This may potentially be due to competition between Microsoft and Meta in the virtual space. 7
