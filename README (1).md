Our group decided to investigate the performance of FAANG stocks and two crypto currencies over the past 5 years, and how various events over the past 5 years may have affected their performance to see if we could identify the best investment(s). We looked into volatility over a 5 year period, and the volatility before and after Covid. 

To determine the volatility of the FAANG stocks and crypto we created a box and whisker plot that compared the percent change per day for each stock and coin. The stock or coin that had the largest whiskers indicated the most volatility.  DOGE had the largest whiskers at +/- 6.35%, then BTC at +/- 4.69%, followed by NVDA at +/- 4.55%, and MSFT at +/- 4.33%. Furthermore, by looking at the median values for each stock over the 5 year time period, we could tell that on average you would have lost money investing in MSFT and AAPL over that 5 year time period, since those two stocks have a median percent change of -2.27% and -1.50%, respectively. Due to the amount of outliers in crypto, we had to separate the FAANG stocks from the crypto to get an idea of what the box and whisker plots would actually look like. Given the information from the 5 year volatility, if you only had a limited amount of time to invest and wanted to gamble, the two best options would be DOGE and BTC since they have the most amount of outliers in which you could hope to get in on the increased volatility, otherwise your other best options would be either be GOOG or META since their median daily percent change values were 0.08% and 0.05% which would net you a small daily profit.

After reviewing the 5 year volatility, we decided to take a closer look at how volatile stocks were before and after Covid. Looking at the FAANG stocks specifically, they saw an average of about +1 in volatility with Netflix being the most volatile of the Group adding 2% volatility over this timeframe. This data can be found by looking at the “2018-01-01 to 2020-03-11” & “2020-03-13 and 2023-01-01" Date ranges in the code that calculates Volatility. It is also important to note that this ‘+1%’ increase in volatility is also reflected in the Nvidia Stock within the same date ranges.

Continuing with the above date ranges, compared to the other cryptocurrency, Bitcoins’s volatility remained relatively tame, with the box-plot remaining virtually identical between the two timeframes, and the outliers only raising by about 10% maximum.
DOGE is where everything changed. on the outset of this project, we knew that Dogecoin would be interesting to graph, but due to the volatility jump from 70% to above 350%, we had to rethink how some of the graphs would make it into the slide-deck. For Perspective, was almost 9 times more volatile than Bitcoin and over 35 times more volatile than Google. Based on Volatility alone, it is simpler to make suggestions on what NOT to invest in. That would be crypto.

To further explore how a major change in a company could affect a stocks performance, we narrowed down our focus into the name change of Facebook to Meta. We see the stock price of Facebook rapidly rise during the week prior to Facebook's name change to Meta. This could suggest that investors are embracing the metaverse as an interactive environment for individuals and businesses to interact with activities and potential unique forms of advertising. During the month after the name Change to Meta, we see that the stock price has lost momentum and recorrected itself back to its range it had the month prior to the name change.

Although not technically a FAANG stock, Nvidia experienced the highest growth compared to the FAANG stocks durting the first two weeks prior to the Facebook - Meta name chenge. Investors could as well be embrasing Invidia with Meta. Since the metaverse would need supporting systems and GPUs of which Nvidia is well known for, investors may have seen potential for Nvidia's growth.

We see that Nvidia's stock price does fall sujbstantially a month after the Facebook-Meta name change, but still remained roughly 30 points higher than the weeks leading to the name change.
A stock that we see decline prior to the namechange is Microsoft. Microsofts stock began to decline by 5 points the week prior to the namechange, then continuw to decline another 8 points in the preceding the name change. This may potentially be due to competition between Microsoft and Meta in the virtual space.
